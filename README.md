# Bullpen Code Challenge
## Mock Team Interview.


### Team work dynamics:
The team must coordinate to finish out the following project:
Make a simple web page, (without design or paraphernalia) that detects the word "easteregg", if it's entered correctly, the page shows an alert with the message: "You got a chocolate!".

### Rules:
- JS Vanilla or React can be used, at the team's choice.
- It is not necessary for each member to program, they can choose "pair" programming or organize themselves in the way that best suits them.
- If the team chooses React, the project must contain a README file with the basic information needed to run it on any computer (just the basic information, no working documentation).
- There will be no input field of any kind, the page should "catch" the word at any time.
